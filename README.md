# Discord Bot

At the request of a discord server, I built them a bot with specific capabilities:
(They also requested the bot be named Igor. Feel free to change that if you use this code.)

## Prefix

Commands must always start with 'Igor, ' or 'igor, ' or '/'.

## Hangman 🔤

Igor can play one game, and that is Hangman. Here are the commands you can use to play:

 - `hangman` or `play hangman`
 - `guess _` (ex. `/guess a`)
 - `quit` or `quit game`

## Astronomy 🔭

Igor seems to have become interested in astronomy. Here are a few things Igor knows:

 - `iss`, `location of iss`, `locate iss`, etc.
 - `moon phase`, `phase of moon`, etc.
 - `picture of the day`, `astro pic`, `photo of the day`, etc.

## Dictionary 📚

In an effort to expand the server's vocabulary, Igor has access to some dictionaries:

 - `define _____` for dictionary.com
 - `udefine _____` for urban dictionary

## Chat 💬

Igor doesn't know how to say much. That's it, no caveat.

 - just @ mention Igor in your message and maybe you'll get a response
